## :bulb: About The Project
#### Frontend Application:
* Using this tool teammates can search for available hotfixes in database. Multiple filters are provided for narrowing the scope of results.
* It was a frequent task to search the available hotfixes, and we used to manually search in the excel sheet every time.
* This tool is specific to my team because of the restrictions of excel data format.

#### Backend Application:
